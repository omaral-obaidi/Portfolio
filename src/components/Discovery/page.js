                  The journey I took to design a wearable watch with a Raspberry
                  Pi has been an incredible learning experience, even though I
                  wasnâ€™t able to fully assemble the project. The entire process
                  allowed me to dig deeply into the planning and research
                  stages, where I mapped out feature requirements and developed
                  a clear roadmap for implementing core functions of the watch
                  like time display, alarms, and power management. Through my
                  research, I gained a foundational understanding of each
                  component needed for the watchâ€”such as displays, RTC modules,
                  and power solutionsâ€”and learned about the nuances of
                  integrating hardware with the Raspberry Pi. I spent time
                  exploring and learning wiring techniques, soldering
                  fundamentals, PCB design, and the software libraries required
                  to make these elements work together, giving me a solid
                  foundation of the practical skills required to build the final
                  product.

                  Despite not reaching the assembly phase, each challenge I
                  encountered clarified the technical steps and skills I need to
                  make this project a reality. By exploring 3D printing for
                  enclosure design and studying how to establish secure battery
                  connections (which I was able to do through attending multiple
                  workshops), I now have a solid roadmap for turning this
                  concept into a wearable device. The experience highlighted my
                  interest in embedded systems and interactive hardware,
                  deepening my enthusiasm for future projects that blend
                  creativity with hands-on tech. Although unfinished, this
                  project has sparked my passion and set a foundation for
                  advancing my skills in hardware development and innovative
                  device design.
